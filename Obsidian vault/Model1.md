# Question
In Python, what operator is used to perform floor division, which is defined as obtaining the largest integer less than or equal to the division of two numbers? Consider the following code snippet:
```python
a = 15
b = 4
result = a // b
```
What will be the result of the floor division operation?

- [ ] `//` - The double forward-slash operator in Python returns 3 for the floor division of 15 by 4.
- [ ] `%` - The percent operator returns the remainder and is incorrect for floor division; the result is not 3.
- [ ] `/` - The single forward-slash operator performs true division and is incorrect for floor division; the result is not 3.
- [ ] `**` - The two asterisks operator is for exponentiation, not division; it is incorrect in this context.
