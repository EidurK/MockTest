# Fact

Consider a relation 𝑅(𝐴, 𝐵, 𝐶, 𝐷, 𝐸) and a collection of functional
dependencies (FD’s) 𝐹 = {𝐵 → 𝐸, 𝐵 → 𝐴, 𝐶𝐸 → 𝐵, 𝐶 → 𝐷}
What are all the candidate keys of 𝑅?

# Question
Which of the following sets of attributes does not qualify as a candidate key for the relation $R(	ext{Student	extunderscore ID}, 	ext{Course	extunderscore ID}, 	ext{Semester}, 	ext{Grade})$ given the functional dependencies?

- [ ] 1. `{Student_ID, Course_ID}`
- [ ] 2. `{Student_ID, Semester}`
- [ ] 3. `{Course_ID, Grade}`
- [ ] 4. `{Course_ID, Semester}`
