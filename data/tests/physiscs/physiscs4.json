Cylinder A has a large diameter and Cylinder B has a small diameter. How does the distribution of mass relative to the axis of rotation explain which cylinder has a larger moment of inertia?", "options": ["Cylinder A has a larger moment of inertia because its mass is distributed farther from the rotation axis.", "Cylinder B has a larger moment of inertia because a smaller diameter concentrates more mass near the rotation axis.", "Both cylinders have the same moment of inertia since their masses are identical.", "Cylinder B has a larger moment of inertia because a smaller diameter leads to a higher rotational speed."]}, {"question": "Consider two point masses, 5.0 kg and 7.0 kg, placed 4.0 m apart. When rotated about an axis, their moment of inertia changes with the axis location.

When the axis is shifted so that it is 0.50 m from one of the masses, the moment of inertia becomes 143 kg\u00b7m\u00b2. Which explanation best accounts for the difference in the moment of inertia between these two scenarios?", "options": ["a) The moment of inertia increases as a mass rotates further from the axis because its contribution is proportional to the square of its distance.", "b) The total mass is larger in the second scenario, which directly increases the moment of inertia.", "c) The moment of inertia decreases when one mass moves closer to the axis, regardless of the other mass's contribution.", "d) The moment of inertia remains constant for a given set of masses; only the angular velocity changes."]}, {"question": "Consider three objects with identical mass M and radius R\u2014a thin hoop (with I = MR\u00b2), a solid cylinder (with I = (1/2)MR\u00b2), and a solid sphere (with I = (2/5)MR\u00b2).
