For instance, a large-diameter cylinder (mass farther from the axis) has a greater I than a smaller-diameter cylinder of equal mass."},{"reasoning":"This key example demonstrates how the axis of rotation affects the moment of inertia and emphasizes that mass close to the axis contributes little.","info":"Example 8-9: Two masses (5.0 kg and 7.0 kg 4.0 m apart) yield different I values when rotated about different axes.

In the absence of a net torque (Στ = 0), L is conserved. This principle explains phenomena like a skater spinning faster when arms are pulled in, since I decreases and ω increases to keep Iω constant."},{"reasoning":"An extended application illustrates combining conservation of angular momentum with energy and torque analysis.","info":"Example 8-14 (Clutch): Two disks with different masses and moments of inertia are used to show how angular momentum is conserved when they couple (I_Aω_1 = (I_A + I_B)ω_2). Calculation details include finding L for the first plate, the required torque to accelerate it, and the resulting slower angular speed ω_2 after engagement."}]}
