This ensures no linear or angular acceleration."},{"reasoning":"Reviewing the equilibrium conditions is fundamental for many statics problems.","info":"**First Condition (Force Equilibrium):** For an object to be in equilibrium, the vector sum of the forces must be zero. In components (usually in the x and y directions):\n\nΣFₓ = 0, ΣFᵧ = 0, (and ΣF_z = 0 if applicable).\n\n*Key point:* When forces act in two dimensions, only the x and y components need to be considered."},{"reasoning":"The torque condition prevents rotation, a topic that appears in many problems.","info":"**Second Condition (Torque Equilibrium):** The sum of the torques about any chosen axis must be zero (Στ = 0).

If uncertain about a force direction, assume one; a negative result indicates the force is in the opposite direction."},{"reasoning":"Understanding examples cements these principles and shows common pitfalls and techniques.","info":"**Example 9-1 (Braces for Teeth):** Two equal forces in a wire band apply forces at different angles to a tooth.
