- [ ] The sum of torques about any point must be zero.
- [ ] Both the sum of all forces in every direction and the sum of all torques about any point must be zero.
- [ ] It is sufficient for the net acceleration (both linear and angular) to be zero, even if the individual force components do not exactly cancel out.

A 5 kg block is placed on a frictionless incline angled at 30° and is connected by a light rope over a pulley to a hanging 3 kg mass. When constructing the free-body diagram (FBD) for the block on the incline, which procedure best follows the principles of FBDs and Newton’s third law?

- [ ] Draw only the gravitational force acting on the block, since all other forces are negligible on a frictionless plane.
- [ ] Include every force acting on the block: its weight (resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the incline), the normal force at the point of contact, and the tension in the rope; also recognize that for each force depicted, Newton’s third law implies an equal and opposite force acts on another object.
- [ ] Focus solely on the forces along the direction of the block’s motion by resolving the weight into one component, and omit perpendicular forces because they cancel each other out naturally.
- [ ] Sketch forces acting on both the block and the hanging mass in the same diagram, without separating them, to simplify the analysis.

A horizontal beam is supported at two points and is subjected to several external loads. When using the torque (or moment) equilibrium equation (Στ = 0) to solve for an unknown reaction force, which strategy is most effective?

- [ ] Take moments about a point that does not lie on the line of action of any unknown forces, so every force contributes to the torque.
- [ ] Choose an axis that passes through one of the unknown forces to eliminate its moment contribution, thereby reducing the number of unknowns in the equation.
- [ ] Always calculate moments about the center of mass of the beam to ensure symmetry in the equations.
- [ ] Select an arbitrary point, because the choice of axis does not affect the solution of the equilibrium equations.

Consider a scenario where two equal but opposite forces are applied to opposite ends of a door, with each force acting at different distances from the door’s hinge. Which of the following best describes the physical effect produced by these forces?

- [ ] They create both a net force and a net torque, causing the door to both move linearly and rotate.
- [ ] They produce a net torque that leads to the rotational motion of the door without causing any linear (translational) movement.
- [ ] They cancel each other completely, resulting in no movement or rotation.
- [ ] They produce a net force that causes the door to move in one direction without any rotation.

In applying the five-step process for solving statics problems, consider a scenario where a ladder leans against a wall with multiple forces acting on it (gravity, friction, and normal forces). After selecting the ladder as the object and drawing its free body diagram (FBD), what is the most critical next step to simplify your calculations for finding the unknown forces?

- [ ] Resolve all forces into their components by choosing an appropriate coordinate system.
- [ ] Immediately write the moment equilibrium equation without considering force components.
- [ ] Estimate the numerical values of forces based on similar problems.
- [ ] Assume that friction is negligible to simplify the problem.

A uniform beam of length L is hinged at one end to a wall and held in equilibrium by a cable attached to its free end, which makes an angle θ with the horizontal. The beam has a mass m (with its weight acting at its center) and supports an additional point load W acting at its midpoint. Which of the following methods correctly describes how to determine the tension in the cable as well as the reaction forces at the hinge?

- [ ] Only consider vertical force equilibrium by setting the sum of vertical forces to zero, as the horizontal forces do not affect torque.
- [ ] Apply equilibrium conditions by setting the sum of forces in both horizontal and vertical directions to zero, and additionally take moments (torque) about the hinge point.
- [ ] Calculate the cable tension by assuming it is equal to the total downward force (beam weight plus load) divided by sin θ, without considering the hinge reactions.
- [ ] Balance only the torques about the midpoint of the beam, assuming that forces at the hinge are negligible.

A lever is used to lift a heavy object weighing 200 N. The object is placed 0.5 m from the fulcrum, while the applied force is exerted 2.0 m from the fulcrum. Using the torque balance relation (FₚR = mg·r), what is the magnitude of the force that must be applied to lift the object?

- [ ] 20 N

- [ ] 800 N

A 3-kg book is resting on a horizontal table. When analyzing the forces, a student initially assumes that the upward normal force acting on the book is positive. In a subsequent calculation, the normal force is found to be -30 N. Which statement best explains the meaning of this negative result and corrects a common misconception about action-reaction forces in this context?

- [ ] The negative sign indicates that the actual direction of the normal force is opposite to the assumed direction (i.e., downward), and it emphasizes that the normal force on the book is not the reaction force to its weight; instead, the reaction force is the force the book exerts on the table.
- [ ] The negative sign shows that the book is accelerating downward, meaning the table is not exerting enough force to support the book, and the normal force on the book is therefore the reaction force to the gravitational pull.
- [ ] The negative value is a calculation error because forces such as the normal force should always be positive in magnitude; furthermore, the normal force on the book is the reaction of the table on the book, which should be identical to the book's weight.
- [ ] The negative sign implies that friction is acting in the opposite direction of the normal force, and consequently, the normal force on the book serves as the action force while friction acts as the reaction force.
***
In the context of computing weight or forces, why is it beneficial to keep the gravitational constant 'g' as a variable until the final step of calculations?

- [ ] It preserves the symbolic form of the expression, making it easier to adjust for different gravitational conditions and relate the result to familiar weight values.
- [ ] It automatically adjusts the numerical values during each calculation step to ensure maximum precision with units.
- [ ] It simplifies unit conversion by converting mass directly into acceleration without any extra steps.
- [ ] It eliminates rounding errors by numerically computing 'g' at every intermediate step.
